# Welcome to WORSICA's documentation!

WORSICA (Water Monitoring Sentinel Cloud Platform), a service that integrates remote sensing and in-situ data for the determination of water presence in coastal and inland areas, applicable to a range of purposes from the determination of flooded areas (from rainfall, storms, hurricanes or tsunamis) to the detection of large water leaks in major water distribution networks. 

WORSICA is a one-stop-shop service to provide access to customized remote sensing services based on Copernicus data, currently applied to the detection of the coastal water land interface and the inland water detection (for large water infrastructure leak detection).

This documentation is aimed to help actual and future WORSICA maintainers to assure the maintenance and evolutive integration of new features on this tematic service. Remember, WORSICA thematic service is under development, and thus, this documentation may suffer changes during its development.
